# Starlink Backbone Map

## How to participate

If you have (access to) a Starlink dish, you can help the community identifying the Starlink backbone map topology by running the backbone traceroute scripts.

### Note

If you are running `Tailscale` on the same node which you are going to execute `traceroute`/`tracert`, Tailscale's CGNAT subnet `100.64.0.0/10` is in conflict with Starlink's CGNAT subnet for regular users. Thus, you may notice you cannot ping Starlink's gateway at `100.64.0.1`.

You can disable the behavior via 

```bash
sudo tailscale up --netfilter-mode=off
```

or configure iptables accordingly. See [also](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/3104).

### Linux

Ideally, you should have access to a Linux like environment, either it is a Linux machine, or a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment.

You may also want to install the `traceroute` package instead of the default `inetutils-traceroute` package on some Linux distributions. Check the version installed by `apt list --installed | grep traceroute` on Debian-based Linux distributions.

[traceroute-bb.sh](./script/traceroute-bb.sh)

### Windows

If you only have access to a Windows machine and you cannot install WSL or a Linux virtual machine, you can run a simplified version of the script in PowerShell. 

[traceroute-bb.bat](./script/traceroute-bb.bat)

In either case, you can download the corresponding script and run it in your environment. The running time of the traceroute script is approximately a few hours.

Submit your `traceroute`/`tracert` result by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/clarkzjw/starlink-lens/issues/new?assignees=clarkzjw&labels=traceroute&projects=&template=starlink-backbone-traceroute-report.md&title=%5Btraceroute%5D+%5BCITY%5D-%5BCOUNTRY%5D).
