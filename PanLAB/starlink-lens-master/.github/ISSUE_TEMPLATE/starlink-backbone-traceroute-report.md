## Where is your Starlink dish? (You only need to provide the city name and country name)

**City**:
**Country**:

## What is the hostname of your Starlink IP address? (You do **NOT** need to provide your IP address publicly)

**Hostname**:

Howto:

1. You can visit https://ifconfig.io/json or https://www.whatsmyip.org/ and only copy the string for `hostname` or `Your Hostname:`.

2. You can also run `nslookup $(curl -s -4 ifconfig.io)` or `nslookup $(curl -s -4 ifconfig.io)` and only copy the string after `name =`.

3. In either case, your hostname should be in the format of `customer.<PoP>.pop.starlinkisp.net.`, e.g., `customer.tkyojpn1.pop.starlinkisp.net.`
